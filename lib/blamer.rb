# This class analyzes an Occurrence and determines which Bug is responsible. A
# new Bug is created if no existing Bug matches the search criteria.
#
# Usage
# -----
#
# To re-calculate blame for an existing Occurrence, and potentially re-assign it
# to a different Bug, it is sufficient to pass the Occurrence to this class's
# initializer.
#
# To assign blame to a new, unsaved Occurrence, it will be necessary to create
# an unsaved Bug and fill it out with the data Blamer needs in order to perform
# its search. This data is:
#
# * the Bug's `environment`,
# * the Bug's `class_name`, and
# * the Bug's `deploy`, if any.
#
# This new Bug should be temporarily associated with the Occurrence before the
# Occurrence is given to Blamer. The result of the {#find_or_create_bug!} method
# will always be a different, saved Bug; you should leave your temporary Bug
# unsaved.
#
# Matching to a Bug
# -----------------
#
# In order to match an Occurrence to a Bug, the line number of the backtrace
# that is at fault must first be determined. This is done probabilistically, by
# assigning a score to each line of the backtrace and picking the line with
# the highest score. Currently, the factors that influence a line's score are
#
# * the "height" of that line in the backtrace, and
# * the age of the commit that most recently modified that line.
#
# The highest-scoring file and line number are termed the **relevant file** and
# **relevant line**.
#
# An Occurrence is matched to a Bug using three mandatory criteria:
#
# * the relevant file path,
# * the relevant line number, and
# * the class name of the raised exception.
#
# In addition, if a "blamed" commit is available for the relevant file and line,
# the bug is matched on that commit ID as well. Note that the exception message
# is _not_ included in the search criteria.
#
# While each Occurrence maintains the original exception message, the Bug
# filters the exception message to remove occurrence-specific information. There
# are two ways of filtering exception messages:
#
# * If the exception can be filtered using {MessageTemplateMatcher}, that
#   filtered message is used.
# * Otherwise, a general search-and-replace is used to replace likely
#   occurrence-specific information (like numbers, inspect values, etc.) with
#   placeholders.
#
# All placeholders take the form "[ALL CAPS IN BRACKETS]" so that the view can
# recognize them as such and format them appropriately.
#
# Deployed Projects
# -----------------
#
# For Occurrences that come from Projects deployed onto client platforms, the
# Deploy is also taken into account. For such Projects, the Blamer will try to
# find, in order:
#
# * an open Bug matching the search criteria under any Deploy,
# * a fixed Bug matching the criteria under the current Deploy, or
# * a newly-created Bug.
#
# In no case will an open Bug in a different Deploy be chosen.
#
# Reopening Bugs
# --------------
#
# After linking and saving the Bug returned from {#find_or_create_bug!}, you
# should call {#reopen_if_necessary!} to potentially reopen the Bug. This should
# only be done after the Occurrence and Bug are both linked and saved.

  # it will be reopened if new occurrences appear.

                 #   * find any open (not fixed) bug matching the criteria;
                 #   * if such a bug exists, use that bug and alter its deploy_id to
                 #     the given deploy;

    # out, but it doesn't fix the bug, and that same Bug is reused. A new
    # release is out that DOES fix the bug, and the bug is closed. The bug
