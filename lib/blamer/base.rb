# Container module for the {Blamer::Base} class cluster.

module Blamer

  # @abstract
  #
  # Subclasses of this class analyze an Occurrence and determines which Bug is
  # responsible. A new Bug is created if no existing Bug matches the search
  # criteria. Different subclasses implement different strategies for
  # determining fault.
  #
  # Usage
  # -----
  #
  # To re-calculate blame for an existing Occurrence, and potentially re-assign it
  # to a different Bug, it is sufficient to pass the Occurrence to this class's
  # initializer.
  #
  # To assign blame to a new, unsaved Occurrence, it will be necessary to create
  # an unsaved Bug and fill it out with the data Blamer needs in order to perform
  # its search. This data is:
  #
  # * the Bug's `environment`,
  # * the Bug's `class_name`, and
  # * the Bug's `deploy`, if any.
  #
  # This new Bug should be temporarily associated with the Occurrence before the
  # Occurrence is given to Blamer. The result of the {#find_or_create_bug!} method
  # will always be a different, saved Bug; you should leave your temporary Bug
  # unsaved.
  #
  # Deployed Projects
  # -----------------
  #
  # For Occurrences that come from Projects deployed onto client platforms, the
  # Deploy is also taken into account. For such Projects, the Blamer will try to
  # find, in order:
  #
  # * an open Bug matching the search criteria under any Deploy,
  # * a fixed Bug matching the criteria under the current Deploy, or
  # * a newly-created Bug.
  #
  # In no case will an open Bug in a different Deploy be chosen.
  #
  # Reopening Bugs
  # --------------
  #
  # After linking and saving the Bug returned from {#find_or_create_bug!}, you
  # should call {#reopen_bug_if_necessary!} to potentially reopen the Bug. This
  # should only be done after the Occurrence and Bug are both linked and saved.
