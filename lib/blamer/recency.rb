module Blamer

  # This blamer uses the recency of the commit that most recently modified a
  # given stack trace element to determine how likely that line is to be at
  # fault.
  #
  # Matching to a Bug
  # -----------------
  #
  # In order to match an Occurrence to a Bug, the line number of the backtrace
  # that is at fault must first be determined. This is done probabilistically, by
  # assigning a score to each line of the backtrace and picking the line with
  # the highest score. Currently, the factors that influence a line's score are
  #
  # * the "height" of that line in the backtrace, and
  # * the age of the commit that most recently modified that line.
  #
  # The highest-scoring file and line number are termed the **relevant file** and
  # **relevant line**.
  #
  # An Occurrence is matched to a Bug using three mandatory criteria:
  #
  # * the relevant file path,
  # * the relevant line number, and
  # * the class name of the raised exception.
  #
  # In addition, if a "blamed" commit is available for the relevant file and line,
  # the bug is matched on that commit ID as well. Note that the exception message
  # is _not_ included in the search criteria.
  #
  # While each Occurrence maintains the original exception message, the Bug
  # filters the exception message to remove occurrence-specific information. There
  # are two ways of filtering exception messages:
  #
  # * If the exception can be filtered using {MessageTemplateMatcher}, that
  #   filtered message is used.
  # * Otherwise, a general search-and-replace is used to replace likely
  #   occurrence-specific information (like numbers, inspect values, etc.) with
  #   placeholders.
  #
  # All placeholders take the form "[ALL CAPS IN BRACKETS]" so that the view can
  # recognize them as such and format them appropriately.
