# Runs all specs under the following environments:
#
# * MRI and JRuby
# * LDAP-based and password-based authentication
# * LDAP authentication with and without a bind DN
#
# All specs are run with JIRA and PagerDuty enabled.
#
# Note: This will take a long time, and requires that you have JRuby and MRI
# environments set up appropriately. See the script for details.
#
# Also note: This script temporarily writes changes to the test config files.
# It must be run with a clean `config/environments/test` directory. If it is
# aborted partway through, you will need to clean up the files yourself.

# Change this to, e.g., bundle update
BUNDLE="bundle"
# Change this to test only certain spec files
