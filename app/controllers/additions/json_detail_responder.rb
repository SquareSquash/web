# Subclasses `ActionController::Responder` to include a little more detail in
# the JSON response for 422 errors and successful updates. In particular:
#
# * Alters the default response for successful `create` API requests to render
#   the resource representation to the response body.
# * Alters the default response for failing `create` and `update` requests to
#   render the errors object with the object's class name
#   (see {ApplicationController}, section **Typical Responses**).
