Is it your fault?

    Under "Management," assign it to yourself, then commit the fix. Mark the bug
    as fixed when the fix is pushed.

Is it someone else's fault?

    Under "Management," assign it to that person -- they will receive an email
    notification.

Is this not really a bug?

    Under "Management," mark the bug as "no one will fix this." You will no
    longer receive notifications about this non-bug. You can also simply delete
    the bug if it was a one-time test.

You should take one of the above three actions -- don't just let the bug sit
there!

        Yours truly,
        Squash
