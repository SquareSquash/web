# A bug is a group of {Occurrence Occurrences} that Squash believes to share the
# same root cause. Bugs are the core unit of functionality in Squash; they can
# be assigned to {User Users}, {Comment commented} on, etc.
#
# Separate Bugs are created for each `environment` they occur in.
#
# Like {Comment Comments}, each Bug is assigned a `number` in sequence among
# other Bugs of the same Project. This number is used when referring to Bugs,
# providing more useful information than the ID.
#
# Occurrences of a Bug can span multiple {Deploy Deploys} of different revisions
# of the code, so the revision/file/line number is recorded from the first
# occurrence of the Bug. Thus, when `git blame` is run to guess at who is at
# fault, this is done on the revision of the code at the first occurrence.
#
# When a bug is first created, the program determines the relevant file and line
# number. This is in general the highest line of back trace that is not library
# code.
#
# Duplicate Bugs
# --------------
#
# The user can mark a Bug as a duplicate of another Bug; this is done by
# associating the original Bug to the duplicate by way of the `duplicate_of_id`
# relation.
#
# When this happens, all Occurrences of the duplicate Bug are moved to the
# original Bug instead, and future Occurrences are placed under the original
# Bug. Because of this, marking a Bug as a duplicate is irreversible.
#
# When the user deletes a Bug with duplicates, the duplicates are also deleted.
