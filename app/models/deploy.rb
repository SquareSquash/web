# A Deploy record is created every time the {Project} is (for hosted projects)
# deployed to either a staging or production server, or (for distributed
# projects) every time a new release is distributed internally or externally.
# The Deploy records the revision that was deployed and the time the deploy
# occurred. For releases only, it records the internal build identifier of the
# release (e.g., the build number).
#
# {Bug Bugs} will only be associated with deploys that have matching
# `environment` values.
