# Source mapping information for a JavaScript project. This model stores a
# mapping of minified JavaScript code location and symbol names to
# corresponding location and names in the unminified code. It also maps asset
# URLs to the project files those URLs are generated from. See the Squash
# JavaScript client library documentation for more information.
#
# Even if your project is not using minified code, this class is also useful for
# mapping the URLs of deployed JavaScript assets to their original source files.
#
# ### Serialization
#
# Mapping data is generated using the "squash_javascript" gem. The gem produces
# a memory representation of the source map. The gem is also included in this
# project to support deserializing the resulting data.
#
# Serialization is accomplished by YAML-serializing the
# `Squash::Javascript::SourceMap` object, zlib-encoding the result, and then
# base-64-encoding the compressed output. This is also how the `map` property is
# transmitted over the wire.
#
# No support is given for modifying these objects after they have been
# deserialized from YAML.
#
