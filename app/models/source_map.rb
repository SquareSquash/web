# Source mapping information for a JavaScript project. This model stores a
# mapping of generated JavaScript code location and symbol names to
# corresponding location and names in the original code. See the Squash
# JavaScript client library documentation for more information.
#
# Even if your project is not using minified code, this class is also useful for
# mapping the URLs of deployed JavaScript assets to their original source files.
#
# ### Serialization
#
# Mapping data is generated using the "squash_javascript" gem. The gem produces
# a memory representation of the source map. The gem is also included in this
# project to support deserializing the resulting data.
#
# Serialization is accomplished by zlib-encoding the JSON source map, and then
# base-64-encoding the compressed output. This is also how the `map` property is
# transmitted over the wire.
#
# No support is given for modifying these objects after they have been
# deserialized.
#
# ### Source maps in stages
#
# Oftentimes a project's JavaScript code moves through different transformations
# before reaching a final deployed state. For example, the development code
# could be in CoffeeScript, which is then compiled to JavaScript, then
# concatenated, then minified (a three-stage process). The client may generate
# source maps for each of those stages.
#
# In order to convert a stack trace from its original format into one useful in
# the development code, these source maps must be applied in the correct order.
# To facilitate this, SourceMap records have a `from` and `to` field. Stack
# traces are annotated with their production format ("hosted"), and Squash
# searches for source maps that it can apply to that format. It continues to
# search for applicable source maps until the stack trace's format is not
# convertible any further.
#
# Stack traces are searched in a simple linear order and applied as they are
# found applicable. No fancy dependency trees are built.
#
# For example, say the following stack trace was provided:
#
# ````
# 1: foo/bar.js:123 (concatenated)
# 2. foo/baz.js:234 (hosted)
# ````
#
# Squash would first note that line 1 is concatenated, and attempt to locate a
# sourcemap whose `from` field is "concatenated" that has an entry for that file
# and line. It would perhaps find one whose `to` field is "compiled", so it
# would apply that source map, resulting in a different stack trace element
# whose type is "compiled". It would then search again for another source map,
# this time one whose `from` field was "compiled", and finding one, apply it,
# resulting in a new stack trace of type "coffee". Finding no source maps whose
# `from` field is "coffee", Squash would be finished with that line.
#
# Line two would proceed similarly, except Squash might find a source map with
# a `from` of "hosted" and a `to` of "concatenated". From there, the logic would
# proceed as described previously.
#
# The Squash JavaScript client library always adds the type of "hosted" to
# each line of the original backtrace, so your source-mapping journey should
# begin there.
