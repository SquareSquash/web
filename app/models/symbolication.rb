# Symbolication information for a project. This model stores an array of address
# ranges and the file, line, and method information for each of those ranges.
# Symbolication can then be done by finding the information corresponding to a
# range that includes a particular program counter address.
#
# Symbolication objects are uniquely referenced by UUID. This is because Xcode
# generates a UUID for each new build and architecture of a project. The UUID is
# then distributed with the project, and used to look up the correct
# Symbolication to use.
#
# For projects in compiled languages that do not attach a UUID to their debug
# data, the Squash client library for that language will need to generate its
# own UUID, to be distributed with the project.
#
# For more information on symbolication generally, see the README.
#
# ### Symbol Data
#
# Symbol data is generated using the "squash_ios_symbolicator" gem. The gem
# produces data structures that can be compactly serialized. The gem is also
# included in this project to support deserializing the resulting data.
#
# Serialization is accomplished by YAML-serializing the `Symbols` or `Lines`
# object, zlib-encoding the result, and then base-64-encoding the compressed
# output. This is also how the `symbols` and `lines` properties are transmitted
# over the wire.
#
# No support is given for modifying these objects after they have been
# deserialized from YAML.
#
