# An individual occurrence of a {Bug}, or put another way, a single instance of
# an exception occurring and being recorded. Occurrences record all relevant
# information about the exception itself and the state of the program when the
# exception occurred.
#
# Most of this data is part of the metadata column and is therefore schemaless.
# Rather than tailoring the fields to one particular class of projects (e.g.,
# Rails apps), new fields can be easily added to fit any type of project.
#
# Occurrences can also have `user_data`. This is typically added at runtime by
# the code when the exception is raised, and provides freeform contextual data
# relevant to the error.
#
# There are a number of SQL triggers and rules to ensure cached counters and
# similar fields are kept in sync between {Bug Bugs} and Occurrences; see the
# migration for further information.
#
# Like {Comment Comments}, each Occurrence is assigned a `number` in sequence
# among other occurrences of the same Bug. This number is used when referring to
# Occurrences, providing more useful information than the ID.
#
# Backtraces, concurrency, and symbolication
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Each Occurrence has multiple backtraces, one for each thread or other unit of
# execution (client specific). These backtraces can appear in one of two
# formats:
#
# ### Current format
#
# The current backtrace format is an array of hashes. Each hash has the
# following keys:
#
# | Key         | Required | Description                                                               |
# |:------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | `name`      | yes      | A name for the thread or fiber.                                           |
# | `faulted`   | yes      | If `true`, this is the thread or fiber in which the exception was raised. |
# | `backtrace` | yes      | The stack trace for this thread or fiber.                                 |
# | `registers` | no       | The value of the registers for this thread (hash).                        |
#
# The `backtrace` value is an array of hashes, one per line of the backtrace,
# ordered from outermost stack element to innermost. Each hash can have the
# following keys (all are required):
#
# |          |                                                     |
# |:---------|:----------------------------------------------------|
# | `file`   | The file name.                                      |
# | `line`   | The line number in the file.                        |
# | `symbol` | The name of the method containing that line number. |
#
# #### Special backtraces
#
# For certain special stack trace lines, a `type` field will be present
# indicating the type of special stack trace line this is. If the `type` field
# is present, other fields will appear alongside it.
#
# For unsymbolicated backtrace lines, the `type` field will be **address** and
# the only other field will be named "address" and will be the integer stack
# trace return address. Unsymbolicated backtrace lines can be symbolicated by
# calling {#symbolicate}, assuming an appropriate {Symbolication} is available.
#
# For un-sourcemapped JavaScript lines, the `type` field will be **minified**
# and the other fields will be:
#
# |           |                                                                    |
# |:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | `url`     | The URL of the minified JavaScript asset.                          |
# | `line`    | The line number in the minified file.                              |
# | `column`  | The column number in the minified file.                            |
# | `symbol`  | The minified method or function name.                              |
# | `context` | An array of strings containing the lines of code around the error. |
#
# Some elements will be `nil` depending on browser support. Un-sourcemapped
# lines can be source-mapped by calling {#sourcemap}, assuming an appropriate
# {SourceMap} is available.
#
# For obfuscated Java backtrace lines, the `type` field will be **obfuscated**
# and the other fields will be (all are required):
#
# |          |                                                         |
# |:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
# | `file`   | The obfuscated file name without path (e.g., "A.java"). |
# | `line`   | The line number within that file.                       |
# | `symbol` | The method name (can be obfuscated).                    |
# | `class`  | The class name (can be obfuscated).                     |
#
# Obfuscated backtrace lines can be de-obfuscated by calling {#deobfuscate},
# assuming an appropriate {ObfuscationMap} is available.
#
# ### Legacy format
#
# Older client libraries may report backtraces in this format:
#
# ```` ruby
# [
#   ["Thread 0", true, [
#      ["file/path.rb", 123, "method_name"],
#      ...
#   ]],
#   ...
# ]
# ````
#
# So, the outermost array is a list of threads. Each entry in that array has
# three elements:
#
# * the name of the thread (client-specific),
# * whether or not the thread was responsible for the exception, and
# * the backtrace array.
#
# Each element of the backtrace array is an array consisting of
#
# * the file path (relative to the project root for non-library files),
# * the line number, and
# * the method or function name (or `nil`).
#
# For certain special cases, this array will consist of other than three
# elements. These special cases are:
#
# #### Unsymbolicated backtrace lines
#
# If a line in the backtrace is not yet symbolicated, it is stored in a different
# format. Each unsymbolicated line of a backtrace becomes a _two_-element array.
# The first element is the constant "_RETURN_ADDRESS_", and the second is an
# integer stack trace return address.
#
# Unsymbolicated backtrace lines can be symbolicated by calling {#symbolicate},
# assuming an appropriate {Symbolication} is available.
#
# #### Un-sourcemapped JavaScript files
#
# If a line in a backtrace corresponds to a JavaScript asset that has not yet
# been mapped to an un-minified source file, it is stored as a six-element
# array:
#
# 0. the constant "_JS_ASSET_",
# 1. the URL of the JavaScript source file,
# 2. the line number,
# 3. the column number,
# 4. the function name, and
# 5. the context (an array of strings [lines of code around the error])
#
# Some elements will be `nil` depending on browser support. Un-sourcemapped
# lines can be source-mapped by calling {#sourcemap}, assuming an appropriate
# {SourceMap} is available.
#
# #### Obfuscated Java files
#
# Java backtraces do not contain the full file path, and the class name can be
# obfuscated using yGuard. If a line in a backtrace comes from a Java stack
# trace, it is stored as a five-element array:
#
# 0. the constant "_JAVA_",
# 1. the name of the source file (can be obfuscated; e.g., "A.java"),
# 2. the line number
# 3. the method name (can be obfuscated), and
# 4. the class name.
#
# Obfuscated backtrace lines can be de-obfuscated by calling {#deobfuscate},
# assuming an appropriate {ObfuscationMap} is available.
#
# Nesting
# -------
#
# This class can record exceptions that have been nested underneath one or more
# parent exceptions, a paradigm that can be seen occasionally in Ruby (e.g.,
# `ActionView::TemplateError`) and far too frequently in Java. It is up to the
# individual client libraries to detect and record nesting parents.
#
# If an exception was nested underneath parent(s), the `parent_exceptions`
# property should be an array of hashes, each hash representing a parent
# exception, ordered from innermost to outermost parent. Each hash takes the
# following keys:
#
# * `class_name` (the name of the exception class)
# * `message`
# * `backtraces`
# * `ivars`
# * `association` (the name of the instance variable containing the inner
#   exception, or some other identifier as to how the two exceptions are
#   associated)
#
# The values for these keys are the same as is described in _Global Fields_
# below unless otherwise specified. The `association` field is optional.
#
# Truncation
# ----------
#
# Because Occurrences store a lot of information, it may be necessary to
# truncate older records. Truncation removes all metadata, leaving only the
# revision, date, and client information. It helps free up space by discarding
# possibly redundant information.
#
# You can truncate Occurrences with the {#truncate!} and {.truncate!} methods.
#
# Redirection
# -----------
#
# It may be the case that an Occurrence needs to move from one Bug to another,
# as for example, when symbolication occurs after an Occurrence is saved, and
# the symbolication reveals that the Occurrence should belong to a different
# Bug.
#
# In this case, a new duplicate Occurrence is created under the correct Bug,
# this Occurrence is truncated, and marked as a redirect. In the front-end,
# visitors to this Occurrence will be redirected to the correct Occurrence.
#
# Unfortunately, the old, truncated Occurrence remains attached to the old
# (incorrect) Bug, negatively impacting that Bug's statistics. No solution for
# this problem has been written.
#
# Redirection should be done with the {#redirect_to!} method.
