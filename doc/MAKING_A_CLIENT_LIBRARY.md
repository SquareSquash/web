Building a Client Library for Squash
====================================

If you want to use Squash in your project, a client library must exist for your
project's language. You may also want a more specific client library for your
particular framework. (For example, there is a general Squash Ruby client
library, and a Squash Rails client library that adds additional HTTP
information to exception notifications.)

A list of existing client libraries is kept up-to-date in the
{file:doc/README_FOR_APP.md readme file}.

If your language or framework isn't in this list, you'll have to write your own
client. Don't worry; it's easy.

General Information
-------------------

Projects are uniquely identified by an API key (UUID), which also serves to
authenticate the client library. Each project can have multiple environments.
No specific definition is given for the concept of an environment; it's
entirely up to the Squash user. They typically correspond to Rails
environments, or perhaps release channels of an iOS project.

The Squash API
--------------

The API has the following endpoints:

### Notifying Squash of a new exception

**Request:** `POST /api/1.0/notify`

**Body:** JSON-formatted hash with the following **required** fields:

|               |                                                                                                                          |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api_key`     | The project's API key. Typically this is configured by the API user.                                                     |
| `environment` | The environment name (e.g., "production"). Also configured by the API user.                                              |
| `client`      | A constant string identifying this client.                                                                               |
| `backtraces`  | An array of backtraces of every relevant thread or fiber at the time of the crash (see Backtrace Format below for more). |
| `class_name`  | The name of the exception class.                                                                                         |
| `message`     | The exception message.                                                                                                   |
| `occurred_at` | The time of occurrence, RFC 2822 format.                                                                                 |

If your client library is for **deployed, hosted applications**, you must also
include a `revision` field with the Git SHA of the deployed revision. If your
client library is for **distributed, installed applications**, you must also
include a `build` field with a uniquely-identifying build number.

There are a myriad other optional fields you can provide with additional
information about your exception. For example, if it occurred on a mobile
device, you could provide the `operating_system` field. A complete list is
available in the {Occurrence} class -- see the class comments and the
`has_metadata_column` call.

You can include any arbitrary fields you like that aren't in the list; they
will be displayed on the occurrence "User Data" tab. If your client library
records data that you wish add native support for in Squash, see "Adding Your
Own Data Fields" below.

**Responses:**

* `200 OK`: Exception received and recorded.
* `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Invalid request body. Perhaps required fields were missing.
* `403 Forbidden`: Unrecognized API key.

### Notifying Squash of a new deploy or build

**Request:** `POST /api/1.0/deploy`

**Body:** JSON-formatted hash with the following **required** fields:

|                       |                                                                     |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `project[api_key]`    | The project's API key. Typically configured by the API user.        |
| `environment[name]`   | The name of the environment that was deployed (e.g., "production"). |
| `deploy[revision]`    | The Git SHA1 of the deployed or released revision.                  |
| `deploy[deployed_at]` | The time of release or deploy, in ISO format.                       |

If your client library is for **deployed, hosted applications**, you must also
include a `deploy[hostname]` field with the name of the computer where the
deploy was initiated. If your client library is for **distributed, installed
applications**, you must also include a `deploy[build]` field with a
uniquely-identifying build number.

**Responses:**

* `200 OK`: Deploy received and recorded.
* `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Invalid request body. Perhaps required fields were missing.
* `403 Forbidden`: Unrecognized API key.

### Sending a symbolication to Squash

**Request:** `POST /api/1.0/symbolication`

**Body:** JSON-formatted hash with the following **required** fields:

|                          |                                                                                   |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `symbolication[uuid]`    | The unique identifier for the symbolication (e.g., the output of `dwarfdump -u`). |
| `symbolication[symbols]` | Symbol data; JSON-serialized, gzipped, and base-64-encoded.                       |
| `symbolication[lines]`   | Lines-of-code data; JSON-serialized, gzipped, and base-64-encoded.                |

For more specific information on those last two fields, see the
[Squash iOS Symbolicator](https://github.com/SquareSquash/ios_symbolicator).

**Responses:**

* `201 Created`: Symbolication received and recorded.
* `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Invalid request body.

### Sending a source map to Squash

**Request:** `POST /api/1.0/sourcemap`

This API endpoint is still a work in progress. It will be used for sending
source maps (e.g., CoffeeScript-to-JavaScript or JavaScript-to-minified) to
Squash.

Backtrace Format
----------------

Squash supports recording multiple backtraces for a single exception, and
recording special kinds of backtrafces. The format of the `backtraces` field
allows this. The field is a JSON-serialized array of hashes. Each hash has the
following keys:

| Key         | Required | Description                                                               |
|:------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`      | yes      | A name for the thread or fiber.                                           |
| `faulted`   | yes      | If `true`, this is the thread or fiber in which the exception was raised. |
| `backtrace` | yes      | The stack trace for this thread or fiber.                                 |
| `registers` | no       | The value of the registers for this thread (hash).                        |

The `backtrace` value is an array of hashes, one per line of the backtrace,
ordered from outermost stack element to innermost. Each hash can have the
following keys (all are required):

|          |                                                     |
|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `file`   | The file name.                                      |
| `line`   | The line number in the file.                        |
| `symbol` | The name of the method containing that line number. |


For certain special backtrace lines, the hash will instead have the key `type`
set and other keys dependent on the value of `type`. These special lines are:

### Unsymbolicated backtrace lines

For unsymbolicated backtrace lines, the `type` field will be **address** and the
only other field will be named "address" and will be the integer stack trace
return address.

### Un-sourcemapped JavaScript files

For un-sourcemapped JavaScript lines, the `type` field will be **minified** and
the other fields will be:

|           |                                                                    |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `url`     | The URL of the minified JavaScript asset.                          |
| `line`    | The line number in the minified file.                              |
| `column`  | The column number in the minified file.                            |
| `symbol`  | The minified method or function name.                              |
| `context` | An array of strings containing the lines of code around the error. |

Some elements will be `null` depending on browser support.

### Obfuscated Java files

For obfuscated Java backtrace lines, the `type` field will be **obfuscated** and
the other fields will be (all are required):

|          |                                                         |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `file`   | The obfuscated file name without path (e.g., "A.java"). |
| `line`   | The line number within that file.                       |
| `symbol` | The method name (can be obfuscated).                    |
| `class`  | The class name (can be obfuscated).                     |

Nested or Wrapped Exceptions
----------------------------

This class can record exceptions that have been nested underneath one or more
parent exceptions, paradigm that can be seen occasionally in Ruby (e.g.,
`ActionView::TemplateError`) and far too frequently in Java. It is up to the
individual client libraries to detect and record nesting parents.

If an exception was nested underneath parent(s), the `parent_exceptions`
property should be an array of hashes, each hash representing a parent
exception, ordered from innermost to outermost parent. Each hash takes the
following keys:

* `class_name` (the name of the exception class)
* `message`
* `backtraces`
* `ivars`
* `association` (the name of the instance variable containing the inner exception, or some other identifier as to how the two exceptions are associated)

The values for these keys are the same as the top-level fields with the same
name unless otherwise specified. The `association` field is optional.

Adding Support for Client Library in Squash
-------------------------------------------

Typically no changes are needed to support your new client library. However,
there are some things you can do to improve that support:

### Update `OccurrencesController::INDEX_FIELDS`

The Occurrences tab of a bug page displays a table of recent occurrences. That
table includes the class name, message, and time of occurrence for each
exception. You can add your own columns to this table, if there is other
important summary information that you wish to include. For example, the Rails
client also adds host, controller, and action columns, and the iOS client adds
device, OS version, and app version columns.

The mapping between client libraries and custom columns is
`OccurrencesController::INDEX_FIELDS`.

### Update the Occurrence page header

By default, the title of the page is the uninformative "Occurrence of MyError".
You can customize this; for example, a Rails error will have the title "MyError
on app01.mycompany.com". You can add a more informative title for your client's
exceptions by modifying the `occurrence_info` method in
`app/views/occurrences/show.html.rb`.

Adding Your Own Data Fields
---------------------------

Any fields in your exception notification JSON that Squash does recognize, get
added to the "user data" hash. If you want more specific behavior for a field,
you can add native support for it in Squash. Check out the `square/squash`
repository and make the following changes:

### Add the field to the `Occurrence` class

`Occurrence` uses a mixin called `HasMetadataColumn` that adds a schemaless,
JSON-formatted column. Adding new fields is done by simply appending to the
hash that is passed to the `has_metadata_column` call. See the other hash
elements for examples. The `Occurrence` class documentation includes a
comprehensive table of known fields; you can add to that as well.

The `Occurrence::NON_AGGREGATING_FIELDS` constant is a list of all fields that
should not be available for the aggregation feature available on a bug's
Occurrences tab. Any fields that are a) a continuous range of values, or b) of
an unusual data type should be included in this list.

### Modify the views to include your fields

The occurrence info page is at `app/views/occurrences/show.html.rb`. It's
Erector (yay, right?). Each tab view is a separate method in that class; the
methods are invoked from the `occurrence_tabs` method. You can either append to
an existing tab, or add a new tab entirely.

### Update the localization to include the field names

Even if English is the only language Squash is localized for, you still need to
update the `config/locales/en.yml` file with the human-readable names for your
new fields, as they are used in a few places throughout the website. The
relevant key path is `activerecord.attributes.occurrence`.

More Information
----------------

Squash is extensively documented. Reading the documentation comments, or
running `rake yard` in the Squash Web repository, will yield comprehensive
docs. In particular, the `Occuurrence`, `Bug`, and `Blamer` class docs are very
informative, as well as the README files for any of the Squash projects.
